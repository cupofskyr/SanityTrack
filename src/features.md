# SanityTrack 2.0: Project Execution Blueprint

## 1. Product Feature Roadmap & MVP Definition

This roadmap translates our strategy into a phased feature list, defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and subsequent versions.

### MVP - The Compliance Core

The essential features required to achieve "Product Parity" with specialists like Jolt and FoodDocs.

*   **Digital Checklists & Task Management:** Core functionality with photo and signature proof of completion.
*   **IoT Temperature Monitoring:** Real-time sensor integration with alerts for equipment failure.
*   **AI-Powered HACCP Plan Generation:** To match the speed and convenience of competitors like FoodDocs.
*   **Basic Food Labeling System:** For tracking and managing food items.

### V2 - The "Health Department Bridge" (Core Differentiator)

A unique portal designed to connect restaurants and health inspectors seamlessly.

*   **For Restaurants:** A dashboard to manage inspection readiness, view past reports, and communicate securely with inspectors.
*   **For Health Inspectors:** A secure login to view a restaurant's live compliance data (temp logs, checklists), schedule inspections, and file digital reports directly on the platform.

### V3 - Strategic Expansion Features

Features that build on the core product to address the "Evolving Consumer Palate" and enterprise needs.

*   **Supplier Compliance Module:** A system for restaurants to manage and verify the food safety certifications of their hyper-local suppliers.
*   **Nutritional & Allergen Database:** Functionality to track detailed ingredient data to support "Food as Medicine" and personalized nutrition menus.
*   **Enterprise Hierarchy & Brand Standards Module:** Tools for multi-location chains to manage compliance across all sites, inspired by CMX1.

## 2. Persona-Driven UX/UI & User Flow Outline

### The Restaurant Owner
*   **Focus:** High-level oversight, risk management, and ROI.
*   **Dashboard:** At-a-glance compliance score, unresolved issues, cost-savings from averted waste, team performance.
*   **Key Flow:** Reviewing daily compliance reports, managing supplier certifications, responding to a health department query.

### The Employee
*   **Focus:** Simplicity, task completion, and accountability.
*   **Dashboard:** Today's assigned tasks, pending checklists, quick-access temperature logging.
*   **Key Flow:** Completing a "Closing Checklist," logging a new food delivery, taking a photo to prove a cleaning task was done.

### The Health Inspector
*   **Focus:** Efficiency, data access, and accurate reporting.
*   **Dashboard:** List of assigned restaurants, upcoming inspection schedule, real-time alerts for critical violations (e.g., a freezer failure).
*   **Key Flow:** Conducting a remote "pre-inspection" by reviewing digital logs, filing an official inspection report on-site using a tablet, sending a follow-up request for documentation through the portal.

## 3. Technical Architecture & Stack Recommendation

A modern, secure, and scalable technology stack that can support the platform's vision, including IoT, AI, security, and HIPAA-readiness.

*   **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for its robust IoT Core, serverless functions (Cloud Functions), and powerful data analytics and AI/ML services (BigQuery, Vertex AI).
*   **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript for its strong ecosystem, performance, and excellent support for serverless environments and AI/ML libraries.
*   **Database:** A hybrid approach using Firestore for structured user and restaurant data, and a PostgreSQL instance with the TimescaleDB extension for handling high-volume, time-series IoT sensor data. This design supports HIPAA compliance requirements.
*   **Frontend:** Next.js with React for its high performance, server-side rendering capabilities, and strong component-based architecture, which is ideal for building the distinct persona dashboards.
*   **AI/ML:** Google's Gemini API for the HACCP plan generator and the future "AI-Powered Personalized Nutrition" engine, leveraging its advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities.
